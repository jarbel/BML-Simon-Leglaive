# Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning (2020/2021)

Course given by [Simon Leglaive](https://sleglaive.github.io/) at [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/).

## General information

Bayesian modeling, inference and prediction techniques have become commonplace in machine learning. Bayesian models are used in data analysis to describe, through latent factors, the generative process of complex data (medical images, audio, documents, etc.) The discovery of these latent or hidden variables from observations is based on the notion of posterior probability distribution, the calculation of which corresponds to the Bayesian inference step.

The Bayesian machine learning approach has the advantage of being interpretable, and it makes it easy to include expert knowledge through the definition of priors on the latent variables of interest. In addition, it naturally offers uncertainty information about the prediction, which can be particularly important in certain application contexts, such as medical diagnosis or autonomous driving for example.

At the end of the course, you are expected to: 

- know when it is useful or necessary to use a Bayesian machine learning approach; 
- have a view of the main approaches in Bayesian modeling and exact or approximate inference; 
- know how to identify and derive a Bayesian inference algorithm from the definition of a model; 
- be able to implement standard supervised or unsupervised Bayesian learning methods.

### Prerequisites

You are expected to be familiar with basic concepts of probabilities, statistics and machine learning. The 1st-year course "statistics and learning" provides all these requirements. 

We will have a session dedicated to the basics of statistical learning, so the most important is that you revise probabilities if you feel like you need to. To do so, you can read Chapter 6 "Probability and distribution" of [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf), by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong, published by Cambridge University Press. 

### Bibliography

Most of the concepts that we will see in this course are discussed in the machine learning reference book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf), by Christopher M. Bishop, Springer, 2006, which is moreover freely available online.

Other useful references are:

- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf), by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong, Cambridge University Press, 2020. (freely available online)
- Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, by Kevin P. Murphy, MIT Press, 2012. (available at the library).

### Evaluation

After each practical session, you should submit a report (in the form of a Jupyter notebook) with both theoretical and practical outcomes. The evaluation of these reports represents 30% of the final grade. The remaining 70% correspond to a final exam.

The exam is scheduled on Thursday, January 28, 9:30-11:30 (2 hours). All documents will be forbidden, but don't worry, if you need formulas such as the probability density functions of common distributions, it will be provided in an appendix.

### Anaconda install instructions

Not only for practicals but also during lectures, we will have to write/run Python scripts and more precisely Jupyter Notebooks. Before the first lecture, you have to install Anaconda (the individual edition) which is the easiest tool to manage Python packages. You can refer to Anaconda's documentation or follow a tutorial video (for instance, [this one in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge) or [this one in French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaw5FhWx2Bk&ab_channel=MachineLearnia).).

With Anaconda, you can easily manage your Python packages. See for instance in the documentation how to install a new package, using Anaconda prompt (which is simply the terminal in Ubuntu or Mac OS).

If you have troubles installing Anaconda, which is very unlikely as it is super simple, you can run Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab, which is a free online computing environment where you can run code on CPU but also GPU. Keep in mind however that working locally on your computer may be more ecological than using Google servers.

## Bayesian linear regression

In the second lecture, we already discussed about linear regression (polynomial regression) and we have seen that with a standard maximum likelihood approach, we have to carefully choose the degree of the polynomial model, in order not to overfit the training data. In Bayesian linear regression, a prior is consider for the weights, which acts as a regularizer and prevents overfitting. Moreover, this Bayesian approach to linear regression naturally provides a measure of uncertainty along with the prediction.

## Revision and other activities

**Activity 1**: Q&A session

**Activity 2**: You will find an exercise [here](session11/revisions.pdf). You will also find exercices (that were left as homeworks) in the slides of the different lectures.

**Activity 3**: If not finished yet, you can continue working on the sparse Bayesian linear regression notebook (the deadline to send your report is tonight).

**Activity 4**: Reading about sequential data processing with latent-variable models.

"State-space models (SSM) provide a general and flexible methodology for sequential data modelling. They were first introduced in the 1960s, with the seminal work of Kalman and were soon used in the Apollo Project to estimate the trajectory of the spaceships that were bringing men to the moon. Since then, they have become a standard tool for time series analysis in many areas well beyond aerospace engineering. In the machine learning community in particular, they are used as generative models for sequential data, for predictive modelling, state inference and representation learning". *Quote from Marco Fraccaro's Ph.D Thesis entitled "Deep Latent Variable Models for Sequential Data" and defended at Technical University of Denmark in 2018.*


The Kalman filter and smoother are used to compute the posterior distribution of a sequence of latent vectors (called the states) given an observed sequence of measurement. In the following video, a Kalman filter is used to track the latent position of multiple persons over time. The latent state variable in this case is continuous.

When the latent state variable is discrete, the state-space model is called a hidden Markov model (HMM). HMMs were very popular for automatic speech recognition, before the deep learning era. The latent state variable in this context is discrete and corresponds to a phoneme (an elementary unit of speech sound that allows us to distinguish one word from another in a particular language), while the observations are acoustic speech features computed from the audio signal.

Chapter 3 of Marco Fraccaro's Ph.D Thesis available [here](https://marcofraccaro.github.io/download/publications/fraccaro_phd_thesis.pdf) gives a very nice introduction to state-space models and Kalman filtering. To go a bit further, Chapter 4 introduces deep latent variable models for sequential data processing, using the framework of variational autoencoders.
